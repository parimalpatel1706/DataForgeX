Former India all-rounder Madan Lal has called on Virat Kohli to reconsider his retirement from Test cricket, saying there is “nothing wrong with returning” and emphasizing Kohli’s passion and value in guiding the national side amid recent challenges. The BCCI also clarified that Kohli’s decision, like Rohit Sharma’s, was entirely his own and not influenced by the board indiatimes.com. Despite the shock of Kohli stepping away after a stellar 14-year Test career, the appeal for his return underscores his enduring importance—and fans are hopeful he might yet don the whites again.
