# DataForgeX
This is my personal learning lab where I'm building my data science skills from scratch. From Python and Pandas to machine learning and real-world projects, I'm documenting everything I learn along the way. No shortcuts â€” just consistent learning, experiments, and a passion for solving problems with data.
