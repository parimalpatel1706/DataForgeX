In 2016, Anushka Sharma emerged as a prominent and principled figure in Bollywood. She starred in two major releases — Sultan and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Sultan was notable not only for its box office success but also for a public backlash when co-star Salman Khan made an insensitive “feeling like a raped woman” remark. Anushka condemned the comment, calling it insensitive and expressing surprise, sparking wider regard for her courage and responsibility . Beyond cinema, she was thrust into controversy when trolls blamed her for Virat Kohli’s poor IPL form. Virat publicly defended her in a viral tweet—calling out the blame game and demanding compassion—an act that became one of 2016’s most influential social media moments . Meanwhile, her film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, released during Diwali, received both praise and criticism, yet further cemented her position in the industry .
